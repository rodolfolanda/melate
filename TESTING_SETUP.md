# Testing Setup Summary

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Installed Vitest Testing Framework**
- `vitest` - Fast, modern test runner with native TypeScript support
- `@vitest/ui` - Beautiful web UI for running tests interactively
- `@vitest/coverage-v8` - Code coverage reporting

### 2. **Created Test Configuration**
- `vitest.config.ts` - Configured with coverage thresholds and exclusions
- Coverage set to 50% minimum (achievable starting point)
- Excludes config files, runner files, and test files themselves

### 3. **Added Test Scripts to package.json**
```json
"test": "vitest run",           // Run tests once
"test:watch": "vitest",         // Run tests in watch mode
"test:ui": "vitest --ui",       // Run tests with web UI
"test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"  // Run with coverage
```

### 4. **Created Comprehensive Test Files**
- `src/__tests__/melate.statistics.test.ts` - 9 tests covering statistics functions
- `src/__tests__/melate.numbers.test.ts` - 11 tests covering number generation

**Total: 20 passing tests** ✅

### 5. **Updated ESLint Configuration**
- Added special rules for test files (relaxed type checking)
- Disabled magic numbers and function length limits in tests
- Added `coverage/` to ignored paths

### 6. **Updated .gitignore**
- Added `coverage/` directory
- Added `.vitest/` cache directory

### 7. **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**
The GitHub Actions workflow now:
1. Runs linting
2. Runs type checking
3. **Runs tests** 🆕
4. **Runs coverage (Node 20 only)** 🆕
5. **Uploads coverage to Codecov** 🆕
6. Builds the project
7. Uploads build artifacts

## 📊 Current Code Coverage

```
File                  | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines
----------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------
melate.statistics.ts  |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100  ✅
melate.numbers.ts     |   71.42 |      100 |      40 |   71.42  ⚠️
melate.history.ts     |    6.06 |      100 |       0 |    6.06  ⚠️
melate.play.ts        |       0 |        0 |       0 |       0  ❌
```

**Overall: 52.59% statement coverage** (exceeds 50% threshold ✅)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch          # Run tests in watch mode (auto-reruns on changes)
npm run test:ui             # Open interactive web UI
npm run test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage report
```

### View Coverage Report
After running `npm run test:coverage`, open `coverage/index.html` in your browser to see a detailed visual coverage report.

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add tests for `melate.history.ts`** - CSV file processing functions
2. **Add tests for `melate.play.ts`** - Game play logic
3. **Increase coverage thresholds** as you add more tests
4. **Set up Codecov** (optional) - Free for public repos, shows coverage badges

## 💡 Test Examples

### Testing Pure Functions (melate.statistics.ts)
```typescript
it('should count occurrences of numbers in CSV data', () => {
  const csvData = `Header,1,2,3
row1,5,10,15`;
  const result = countNumbersInCSV(csvData);
  expect(result[5]).toBe(1);
});
```

### Testing Random Functions (melate.numbers.ts)
```typescript
it('should generate numbers within the specified range', () => {
  const config = { min: 1, max: 49, count: 6 };
  const result = generateRandomNumbers(config, [], [], 0);
  result.forEach(num => {
    expect(num).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1);
    expect(num).toBeLessThanOrEqual(49);
  });
});
```

## 🎉 Benefits

- ✅ **Catch bugs early** before they reach production
- ✅ **Document behavior** - tests serve as living documentation
- ✅ **Refactor confidently** - know if you break anything
- ✅ **CI/CD integration** - automated testing on every push
- ✅ **Code coverage** - see what needs testing
- ✅ **Free on GitHub** - unlimited test runs for public repos
