# Historical Statistics - User Guide

## Overview

The **Historical Statistics** panel analyzes **REAL historical lottery data** from CSV files containing thousands of past draws. The statistics are **NOT** based on simulations - they show actual patterns from historical draws.

## Data Sources

### 6/49 Game
- **File**: `649.csv`
- **Draws**: ~3,400+ historical draws
- **Date Range**: 1982-present
- **Numbers**: 1-49

### Lotto Max
- **File**: `LOTTOMAX.csv`
- **Draws**: ~2,000+ historical draws  
- **Date Range**: 2009-present
- **Numbers**: 1-50

### BC49
- **File**: `BC49.csv`
- **Draws**: ~3,400+ historical draws
- **Date Range**: Similar to 6/49
- **Numbers**: 1-49

## When Data Loads

The historical data loads automatically:
- ‚úÖ **On app start** - Loads 6/49 data by default
- ‚úÖ **When switching games** - Loads that game's CSV data
- ‚úÖ **Independent of number generation** - No need to click "Generate Numbers"

## Statistics Tabs

### 1. üìä Frequency Tab
**What it shows**: How many times each number (1-49/50) has been drawn historically

**Example**:
- Number 7: Drawn 280 times (8.2%)
- Number 42: Drawn 260 times (7.6%)

**Use Case**: Identify which numbers appear most/least often in historical data

### 2. üî• Hot & Cold Tab
**What it shows**: 
- **Hot Numbers** (üî•): Top 10 most frequently drawn numbers
- **Cold Numbers** (‚ùÑÔ∏è): Top 10 least frequently drawn numbers

**Color Intensity**: Darker = more/less frequent

**Interactive**: Click badges to see details (UI feedback ready for future exclusion feature)

### 3. üé≤ Odd vs Even Tab
**What it shows**: Distribution of odd vs even numbers across all historical draws

**Example**:
- Odd: 52,340 draws (51.2%)
- Even: 49,852 draws (48.8%)

**Insight**: Shows if there's a bias toward odd or even numbers

### 4. üìà Ranges Tab
**What it shows**: How numbers distribute across ranges (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc.)

**Example**:
- 1-10: 18,500 occurrences (18.1%)
- 41-50: 15,200 occurrences (14.9%)

**Use Case**: Identify if certain number ranges are overrepresented

## Excluded Numbers

The system automatically excludes:
- **Top 3 most frequent** numbers (Hot numbers)
- **Bottom 3 least frequent** numbers (Cold numbers)

These are highlighted in the Frequency chart with a gray color.

**Why?** To avoid picking the same numbers everyone else picks (hot) or numbers with very low historical frequency (cold).

1. **Open the app** - Historical data loads automatically for 6/49
2. **Click "üìà Show Statistics"** - View the data insights panel
3. **Switch tabs** - Explore different visualizations
